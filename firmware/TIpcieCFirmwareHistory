
TIpcie History
	  FPGA usercode: 0x71Ex0yyz, x=0 for first batch of TIpcie cards;
										 yy firmware version, z firmware revision, "yy.z"
     Oct. 8, 2014,  Based on ModTI (v4.1) design.  The TIDS libary is created, which is copied directly
	from the ModTI design.  In this way, the further improvement over the design can be propagated back to
	ModTI easily.
	  PCIexpress interface is added to replace the VME interface

V1.1 Nov. 10, 2014: The PCIe write to the register successful.  Baseline design existed
V1.2 Nov. 11, 2014: The PCIe read from the register successful.
V1.3 Nov. 12, 2014: The PCIe JTAG read/write is working on PROM JTAG.  Need expand the memory to cover the FPGA JTAG
V1.4 Nov. 17, 2014: The Data Memory status readback (polling) is working, the JTAG (mem1) is expanded to 4KB.
V1.5 Nov. 18, 2014: Clk cleanup, the clock source select works, trigger MGT uses 125MHz.  Connected to the slave/Master TI boards.
V1.6 Nov. 20, 2014: TIpcie event data can now been read out by single word access.
V1.7 Nov. 24, 2014: Set the PCIexpress busy to SRESET(8) (inverted).  PROM with v1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 could not load the FPGA.
V1.8 Nov. 24, 2014: fix the JTAG resetIDLE busy issue.  With the problem, computer hangs with two JTAG reset idle in a row.
V2.1 Nov. 26, 2014: Output the PCIe configure register status to mem0 0x58, 0x60, 0x68 and 0x70; 
    move the FP enable/prescale to 0x44, 0x64; Use 0x74 to set the default event type (VME trigger and Random trigger).
V2.2 Dec. 3, 2014: Add the Memory write for data readout.  The MSIEnable is false, it is legacy interrupt only.  Why?
    The data was written to computer, and the interrupt issued.
V2.3 Dec. 4, 2014: set the BAR2 memory to 1MB, so that a ring buffer can be set in computer memory
V2.4 Dec. 5, 2014: Multiple read on the BAR2 register
V3.1 Jan. 12, 2015: Use mem0 to get the DMA address.  (use 0x58 for lower 32-bit address, 0x54 for DMA setting)
    use mem0 0x140~0x17C to load the event lookup table.  0x54: bit 31: A32/A64 write, bit(15:0): higher A64 address;
V3.2 Jan. 13, 2015: clean up the unlocated ports; fix the 4-header DMA write data length count problem.
V3.3 Jan. 14, 2015: Add the Reset to PCIe Tx_Engine and Rx_Engine
V4.1 Jan. 22, 2015: Split the packet for large data block (Max_Packet_Size), it works for one packet, not two packets
     Jan. 23, 2015: Succeeded in splitting into multiple packets for one data block.  There are problems when the last packet 
	 has two or one 64-bit word in the fifo.  In this case, the DMA will not update to the next 4K block;
V4.2 Jan. 27, 2015: Fix the issue with two/one 64-bit words in FIFO for the last packet issue;
V4.3 Jan. 28, 2015: When the PhysAddrL reached its maximum, increase the PhysAddrH (for readout data block > 4kB).  The PhysAddrH 
    advanced too early.  Use PhysAddrL looped around (back to 0).  Occasionally, (<10**(-10)) the DataAvailable counter is too big.
V4.4 Jan. 30, 2015: Add the DWAvailable downcount protection.  First 32-bit word: D[31:28] = FreeTimer(11:8);
    D[27:16] = DWAvailable(11:0); D[15:8] = FreeTimer(7:0); D[7:0] = Status(7:0)
V4.5 Feb. 4, 2015: connect some BA#0 register readout
V5.1 Feb. 10, 2015: Use common design modules.  The common area is for TI, TD, TS and TIpcie. The 0x44, and 0x60 are used to set
    the front panel TS code input (replaceing 0x48 and 0x74).  The 0x74 is used to set the event type.  (software not compatible!)
V5.2 Mar. 24, 2015: recompile after common area modified for ModTIC and TSFPGAC.

V1.1 Mar. 26, 2015: in developing stage, so it is one behind the TIP/TDP/TSP, FPGA usercode 0x71e02011, when it is stable, 0x71e03011
V1.2 Apr. 10, 2015: Extend the slow end of the periodic trigger; add the indivudual channel delay
V1.3 Apr. 13, 2015: Update for the proper latency setting for trigger2 to trigger 1 auto generation.

V2.5 Dec. 8, 2015: use 0x1C, bit(22) to enable PCIexpress data (DMA) transfer
V2.6 Dec. 10, 2015: Using SW(5) to control the MSIenable (the Interrupt).
     Dec. 11, 2015: Using VmeSetting(23), not SW(5) for MSI enable.  Use VmeSetting(24) to enable, but MSIRequest disable MDA data.
	  Dec. 14, 2015: remove that logic that disabling DMA if MSIEnable is false.  Set MSI response if MSI is enabled.
V2.7 Dec. 14, 2015: Add the chipscope monitoring
V2.6 Dec. 15, 2015: Redo the TX_engine, espe the order in DMA transfer (higher priority).	  
V2.7 Dec. 15, 2015: Use 0x68 to read out the event data
V2.6 Dec. 16, 2015: Use MemDataEn to enable the BlockReady, which will disable DMA TX when MemDataEn is not enabled.
V2.7 Dec. 16, 2015: Use the RX_engine to generate the FIFO readEn.
V3.1 Dec. 17, 2015: Set the MSIEnable to High, and use reg 0x1C, bit(23) to enable 'Interrupt'. Set the TX_engine to Sync Reset
     Dec. 22, 2015: Set the front panel output to Trigger and Busy.  The other two bits are controlled by register
V3.2 Jan. 4, 2016: Reproduce V3.1, and load as rev1 for two revision PROM loading.  rev0: current, rev1: backup.
    Depending on the svf file, the usr can only update rev0 firmware.  
V3.3 Jan. 5, 2016: try to debug the DMA crashing issue.
     Jan. 11, 2016: Use TrigOutFP for front panal trigger output.  Default the Req_Compl_Data_o to '0' (no data).
     Jan. 11, 2016: Crashing is defined as trn_rEOF_n lasting for > 16 clock cycles (ClkPci)
     Jan. 12, 2016: deal with the collision when BR0 read request, and BR2 write finish.
     Jan. 12, 2016: Reverse the TrigOut polarity, Change Rx_Engine to sync reset, and remove the IO TLPs
     Jan. 12, 2016: previous version over simplified the state machine, add the RX_IO_MEM_WR_WAIT back

	  Jan. 13, 2016: Disable the Trn_Tsrc_Rdy_N when the Trn_Tdst_Rdy_N is not ready ('1'). Extend the Reof to 8-bit.
     Jan. 14, 2016: Simplify the Tx_engine, make sure the WAIT_ONE state finishes the previous word.  Added the FnextFull to busy.

     Jan. 15, 2016: Use VmeSetting(31) to select slower ClkSlow for TriggerRule block
V3.4 Jan. 20, 2016: Debug the TX_engine; Removing the chipscope does not make difference; rearrange the PhysAddrH, and MSIresponse
    Introduce DMAReady, so the word counts are prepared before jumping into DMA mode; Initialize DMAReady when Reset
    Remove the trn_tsrc_rdy_n when the trn_tdst not ready.
V3.5 Jan. 21, 2016: Remove the ChipScope and compile.

	  Apr. 20, 2016: update the 0xB8 register
V4.2 Apr. 29, 2016: Use the FrontPanel BUSY input as TSinhibit too (enabled by the BusySrcEn(5)).

     May 3, 2016: Use the FrontPanelBusy for TIbusy (BusySrcEn(4)) and TSBusy (BusySrcEn(5)) directly;
                  Delay the TIBusy loopback/Status(11) by 128ns.

   bufferlevel setting)
V7.2 May 9, 2017: Change the MEMenable from VMEsetting(22) to VmeSetting(26), so that VMEsetting(22) is used for bufferlevel.
   Change the firmware type from 2 to 3, so the FPGA usercode is 71e03VVR.
